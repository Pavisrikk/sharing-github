This will assist anyone visiting or relocating between the cities to consider which areas are most similar to their current neighborhood and therefore might offer their preferred range of amenities. This information is very useful when moving to an unknown city and will help narrow down the list of areas to search for a new home, thus speeding up the relocation process and avoiding overly long and potentially pricey stays in hotels or other temporary living arrangements. Alternatively for those who have kids going to school, this information will be useful in deciding the schools that best fits for their children."
